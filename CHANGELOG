CHANGELOG, 2DPanelMethod

Ver. 0.1.0
-Created initial version of Panel Method code
-Only handles geometry, motion (displacement & pitching), and plotting animation so far. Wake shedding and pressure profile will be addressed in next update
-GEOMETRY:
  -created presets for 'line', 'ellipse', and 'circle' bodies
  -currently bodies are initially centered at the origin (either about their center or quarter-chord). Plan on allowing initial offsets in the future
-DISPLACEMENT:
  -changed from MATLAB code to allow for irregular displacements. Uses stepwise motion
  -currently only allows for only constant velocity or linear accel/deceleration
  -planned to change to follow same structure as PITCHING section and allow for more predefined or custom velocity profiles
-PITCHING:
  -added predefined pitching profiles 'constant', 'constant rate between values', 'constant rate using rate', and 'periodic'
  -currently structured as a function that passes 'args', will be changed in the future to be more consistent between cases
-PLOTTING:
  -uses FuncAnimation module from matplotlib library
  -added option to automatically scale x-axis to fit the displacement of the body
  -added plotscaling calculation to keep consistent scale between axes and prevent graphical distortion of the body
    -if the auto axis scaling causes the plotsize to exceed the display size, the scaling becomes inconsistent. Will fix next update
  -added options to display/hide the body, vortex points, and collocation points respectively
